Description: Fits convolution-based nonstationary
    Gaussian process models to point-referenced spatial data. The nonstationary
    covariance function allows the user to specify the underlying correlation
    structure and which spatial dependence parameters should be allowed to
    vary over space: the anisotropy, nugget variance, and process variance.
    The parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood, using a local
    likelihood approach. Also provided are functions to fit stationary spatial
    models for comparison, calculate the Kriging predictor and standard errors,
    and create various plots to visualize nonstationarity.
